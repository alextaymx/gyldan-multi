NEXT STEP (IMPORTANT)
To finalise & sharpen tone, answer these quickly:
1. Which brand is most important commercially right now?
2. Do you want the tone to be:
• More corporate / institutional, or
• Slightly modern / founder-led?
3. Should Intellex sound more like:
• Tech consultancy
• Internal innovation arm
• Product / platform builder
Once answered, I’ll:
• Tighten copy further
• Remove overlap
• Make the group feel very premium & intentionalPerfect 👍 that actually fits a corporate / institutional site much better.
Below is a refined version of the content, where long paragraphs are broken into short cards, bullets, or highlight blocks, while keeping everything copy-paste ready and aligned with your original structure.
I’ll show MAIN DOMAIN first, then SUB-DOMAIN TEMPLATE, and then example brand content (you can reuse the pattern for all brands).
